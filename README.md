## About the Project

The original specification of the project is from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library).

I implemented a library that saves the information in the localStorage using JavaScript.

If you click the 'Add new book' button, you can create a new book with the following information:
- Author
- Title
- Number of pages
- Status: If you have read the book or not.

After creating the book, you can:
- Remove it from your library using the remove button.
- Change the status to read or unread using the change status button.
